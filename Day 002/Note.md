The program employs a single traversal approach to reverse numbers in the array. This ensures efficiency with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the array.

# ALGORITHM STEP:-

### Step 1 Initialization:

Two arrays, "arr" and "reversed_arr".

arr contain user enter array.<br>
reversed_arr is a empty array.

### Step 2 Iteration Through Array:

For each num in the array:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;insert num to 0 index.

Note:- insert() function insert value on specific location and if any value avaliable on this index than that value forword 1 index.

### Step 3 Result:

After completing the loop, reversed_arr holds the reverse Value.

# Time and Space Complexity

Time Complexity : O(n)<br>
Space Complexity : O(1)
