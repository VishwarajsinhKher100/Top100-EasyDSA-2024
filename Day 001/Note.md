The program employs a single traversal approach to find the minimum and maximum numbers in the array. This ensures efficiency with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the array.

# ALGORITHM STEP:-

### Step 1 Initialization:

Two variables, Max and Min, are initialized.

Max starts with first number of array.<br>
Min starts with first number of array.

### Step 2 Iteration Through Array:

For each element in the array:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compare the element with Max:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is larger, update Max.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compare the element with Min:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is smaller, update Min.

### Step 3 Result:

After completing the loop, Max holds the Largest Value, and Min holds the Smallest Value.

# Time and Space Complexity

Time Complexity : O(n)<br>
Space Complexity : O(1)
